# Competitive Coding

### What?
Just as it looks, this contains my history (still ongoing) of Competitive Coding. It starts from when I stopped using TurboC++ and had difficulties in understanding why linked list is needed and crying because I didn't understood Binary Search. This has probably been the most active repository throughout my engineering journey.

### Why keep this?
Just for the same reason people write a diary/blog. It's like maintaining a photo album. You don't know if you'll ever need it, but it's nice to keep memories.
